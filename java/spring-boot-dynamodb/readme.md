## Spring Boot DynamoDB

This project illustrates how to combine [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), 
[Spring Data DynamoDB](https://github.com/derjust/spring-data-dynamodb) and 
[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to create a simple, domain driven RESTful web service.

The project also uses [SpringFox](http://springfox.github.io/springfox/docs/current/) to provide a 
[Swagger](http://swagger.io) JSON specification for the API which is rendered at the root of the 
deployed service.
